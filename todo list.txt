    - Handle Actors and Targets (DONE)
        - Add a new property in StoryNode that specifies target, and allow the target to be any type of object node. (Done)
        - Add a new property in JointNode that specifies target or actor.
            - This will have to be done both for Normal Rules and Joint Rules
              - For Normal Rules, there is a List of Targets
              - For Joint Rules, there is a List of Targets
    - Handle only one character splitting (DONE)
    - Solution is to instead of splitting into individuals, we split into groups instead (DONE)
        - For example, a node containing Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dave fits the criteria for a split
        - The next node should allow them to split into two groups, Alice Bob and Chalie into left node with no target, dave becomes the main actor of right node
    - test the Joint Node Graph codes to make sure that they work (DONE)
    - Look at REGEN Code (Done)
    - Init Rules:
        - Assassinate
        - Break Ally
        - Fight
        - Forge Ally
        - Give Blackmail Letter
        - Give Gift
        - Murder
        - Murder Blackmailer
        - Rebel
        - Spy
        - Steal
    - Replacement Rules:
        - Ambush
        - Ambush by Hater
        - Caught
        - Encounter
        - More Fight
        - Spare
        - Stealth Kill
        - Stolen Gift
18 Aug 2022 (ALL BACKLOGS COMPLETE)
    - Flexible rules that allows nodes with any number of actors, allowing them to be used in multiple instances (DONE, UNTESTED)
        - For example:
            - If there is more than 1 person doing X, then they are eligible to do Y together with no targets in the next node
    - Get rid of Dummies OR change equality testing (DONE, Dummies gotten rid of in Joint!)
    - How do I even handle targets from the perspective of the Rewrite Rules???? (DONE, TESTED)
        - Since a large portion will be replaced, do I need to list out the targets in all of those instances?
        - What do I need to do with the targets of these ones?
        - (TODO: PAPER PLOTTING REQUIRED)
25 Aug 2022 (ALL BACKLOGS COMPLETE)
    - Handle Targets for Joint Rule (DONE)
    - Test Multi-Group Splitting Rule (DONE)
    - Check Proposal to Compare (DONE)
        - Quality Metrics needs to be done
        - I think that almost everything in regards of the graph has been done except:
            - The untested and the unadded
            - The program that ties up all the components together
                - This includes a function that automates relationship change with targets
            - Graph Visualization
        - Generic Constraints
    - Read and Summarize new Kybartas Paper (DONE)
        - Uses the same story metrics as REGEN
08 Sep 2022
    - Map Representation in World State (DONE)
        - Function in World State, that given a LocationNode, returns all adjacent locations
    - StoryGenerationFunction's rule application will make a Location List this way:
        - Assume the location doesn't change
        - However, if there is an action node that calls for a location change, refer to the map and choose one random location to change to
        - After that, all the actions will be performed in that location unless there is another change
    - Location Adjecnecy Function in World State (DONE)
15 Sep 2022
    - Change the future World States according to Present (Done)
    - Memory issues from copying WorldStates, how much is too much
    - Record only changes to WorldState, keep latest version (DONE)
        - Pending: Rewind back in case of errors
        - Keep 2 world states: Initial Worldstate and Current Worldstate
            - In the case that there is a change to the worldstate, take the initial worldstate and apply all the changes in each step, then make that the new current worldstate
    - Function that takes Tag and Value as input, and then outputs the proper relationship change (where actor/target can be added later) (Done)
    - ApplyRule, but with past timesteps
        - 
    - Check if Character is in the same location
        - Take the init step, advance it until it hits the place we want to check, and then check relationship
25 Sep 2022
    - Undo state changes (DONE)
        - Run from the initial state, input number and run through?
        - Run from final state, input number and reverse?
    - Effect on next Timestep must be developed in order to define how the stories will change (Partially done, but still unsure)
        - Either this, or parameters are needed
            - Figure out what parameters are needed
            - Define how each actions/events will change states and tags
    - Rule Change in the story cannot force the State Changes yet
        - Oh, they are about to. We just need a little bit of setup.
    - Rewrite Rule that applies Story Node Changes then applies World State Changes (Planned, now we intend to interleave to make things clearer)
2 Oct 2022
    - Since RewriteRule uses Tags and Tags are supposed to depend on the current world state, we need to think of what we're supposed to do here
        - Only take into account the first step of the rewrite rule???
        - Remake it so that instead of attaching tag requirements to the change rules, attach requirements to the story nodes instead and check appropriateness of each node as the world state advances?
    - Interestingly, there is no reason that rewrite rule has to take StoryGraph as an input
        - We could use lists of story nodes as condition/replacement for stories
        - We could use lists of world states as condition/replacement for world states (and run a check)
            - Tags work with this method, however, World States requires concrete Characters and Objects, so we'll have to make customized rules for more specific nodes.
    - Still need to check if Character is in the Same Location
        - New EdgeReq type object?
        - ShareLocReq?
            - Contains a list of characters
            - Check the location of the first character, then check if the other characters are in the same location?
    - Need to remake WorldState to interleave with StoryNodes? (DONE)
    - We also need to have the RelChange pull the character from the WorldState instead of the initial character setting (Partially Done)
        - This is required in order to make sure the characters are properly affected by changes when they take actions
        - Instead of calling objects directly, RelChange should contain the name and call the tag's name from the WorldState
        - We can do this, we have node_dict[(node name)]. We'll use it to call the node from the proper WorldState after all the required change are applied.
    - Paired items that are required in order to interact with other items
        - Need a specific key to interact with a door
        - Skeleton Keys exist, and might be able to open all doors
        - Like prof. said, this could work with pairing objects. Example:
            - Red Key {Type: Object, Unlocks: Red}
            - Red Door {Type: Object, State: Locked, UnlockWith: Red}
            - Skeleton Key {Type: Object, Unlocks: [Red, Green, Blue]} (We can exclude tags that a Skeleton Key don't unlock (For example: digital locks with no keyholes))
    - Did a bit of housekeeping and reduced some duplicate code into functions (Entire work will never be done but a lot of it was done. Thanks Ram!)
    - Break up with Magic Variables/Strings and use ENUM-like configurations instead. This includes: (DONE)
        - "add", "remove"
        - Markers for relative nodes
        - Joint Types
9 Oct 2022
    - How important is StoryNode.next_node, exactly...?
        - Since we could figure out next node/previous node information from the StoryGraph itself, it might not be that needed...
        - We'll keep it for now, but if it turns out there's no need to put it there we're removing it to streamline our work process.
