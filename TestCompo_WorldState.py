'''Testing Worldstates

We're gonna going to have to test a lot of things!

WorldState/ObjectNodes:

- Location Dependent World State
- TODO: Draft how it would look like on paper
- Possible: Use the holds edge to show the relationship between the location and a state
- The "object" it has a relation to is an event rather than a physical object
- Example:
    - Bar holds Brawl
    - Forest holds Forest_Fire
    - Town holds Festival

StoryGraph
- Rewrite it to support adding multiple nodes
- TODO: Draft the before and after of how nodes should look like on paper


Node Details:
- The nodes should be taken from P'Put's Quest Generator because it has a Wait property that I want to use
- Use "Wait" nodes as placeholder for characters that do nothing/isn't starting to act yet
